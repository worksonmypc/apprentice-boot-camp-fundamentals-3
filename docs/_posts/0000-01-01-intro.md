## How to boot camp (remotely)

+ Relatively new format for us
+ Setting expectations
  + What to expect from us
  + What we expect from you

--

## We want to hear from you

+ Don’t make us feel like [Professor Orth](https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/he-is-geppetto-73-year-old-unc-law-professor-goes-viral-after-recording-a-video-lecture-with-a-pinocchio-doll-sitting-in-the-front-row-because-he-didnt-want-to-teach-an-empty-class/ar-BB11E8UU)
+ Being remote makes it hard to check you are following
+ We’ll try to ask you questions to gauge understanding

Note: We miss doing this in person.  
Much more engaging for all of us if it is two-way.

## Please interact with us

+ Have your camera on
+ Leave yourself muted unless you have something to say
+ Please feel free to ask a question verbally
+ You don’t need to raise your hand, but if you do we will try to notice and pause so you can talk
+ Hold down spacebar to temporarily unmute like a walkie-talkie
+ If you don’t want to speak up, ask in the #fundamentals-3-bootcamp Slack channel

Note: We prefer Slack as the messages will last a little longer  
If the question requires a detailed response  
If we don’t respond within a minute or so, we haven’t noticed

Note: You’ll get the most out of this if you stay present.  
Plenty of sources of distractions.  
Think of yourselves as out of office.

--

## Be present

+ Mute your notifications
  + Slack: `/dnd 8 hours` and `/status In training session`
  + macOS: choose ‘Do Not Disturb’ from ‘Control Centre’ on the menu bar
  + Windows: turn on ‘Quiet Hours’ from the ‘Action Center’ icon on the taskbar
+ Put your phone in DND and put it out of reach
+ You don’t have to take notes
+ Ask questions
+ Use headphones if your environment is noisy

Note: We’ve taken steps to make sure we won’t be distracted from working with you.
