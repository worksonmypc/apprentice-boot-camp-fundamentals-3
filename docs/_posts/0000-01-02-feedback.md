## You didn’t like…

+ Duplication exercise was very confusing
+ Lecturey bits—hard to pay attention for a long time
+ Could have been more voluntary cooperation in break-out rooms (conversation?)
+ Complex code took away from time on the task
+ Tutors had a pre-written solution they were aiming for / didn’t feel like they were on the same journey as students
+ Didn’t cover design patterns
+ Could be more interaction between language groups
