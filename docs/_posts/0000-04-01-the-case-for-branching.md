## The case for branching‚Ä¶

--

## Branches

+ Protect the main code-base from incomplete changes
+ Enable parallel streams of development
+ Make the history more legible

--

## Feature Branch Workflow

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶ all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the master branch. ‚Ä¶ makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the master branch will never contain broken code ‚Ä¶‚Äù
> ‚Äî[Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

## How do feature branches enable CD?

+ Nobody works on the master branch
    + thus master is always releaseable
+ Any feature-based changes made on a feature branch
+ Some Continuous Integration systems only run on master...


Note:
Mention that some people consider that not running against master isn't true CI.

> The normal git workflow involves the use of a lot of branches.
> Each line of development can be separated into a separate ‚Äútopic branch‚Äù and maintained independently.
> Branches in git are cheap, there is no reason to not make free use of them.

> Torvalds: So I think it used to be true but isn‚Äôt any more. There is a few reasons people feel that way, but I think only one of them remains. The one that remains is fairly simple: ‚Äúyou can do things so many ways.‚Äù

Note:
I'm increasingly of the opinion that there is only one real explanation for how git works, and that is that it is alien technology ;-)

Note:
Branches can easily get out of control, they should be few in number and short-lived - you have been warned.

--

### Git guidelines

+ Mostly use a small set of commands:
  + clone, add, commit, log, push, pull
+ Sprinkle in some others
  + checkout, rebase, merge, reset
+ Use a consistent workflow
+ Branches should be short-lived
+ The number of branches should be small

## Merging

<img src="https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:09308632-38a3-4637-bba2-af2110629d56/07.svg?cdnVersion=ks">


Note:
What is a merge
Sometimes it's easy
And sometimes it's hard

<backgroundimageopacity>0.25</backgroundimageopacity>

+ Git is actually good at merging
+ Some merges are simple
+ Some merges are not
+ Keeping your branches short-lived decreases the risk of complicated merges
    

--


## Different kinds of merge

+ Simple
    + Different files
    + Same file, different lines
    + Same file, same lines
+ Complicated

Note:
Whiteboard what might be simple and complex merges with the group

--

## Diverging branches

<img src="images/diverging_branches.svg">

+ The problem gets worse with distance and time


Note:
It's not just the change itself that determines the complexity of the merge, they get worse with distance and time.
You can end up with separate bits of software.
Like straddling two diverging canoes.


--

## A simple merge

<img src="images/green_merge.png">

+ Be a little wary

Note:
Worth pointing out that just because a merge can be completed automatically, does not guarantee the functionality is
correct.

--


## A complicated merge

<img src="images/merge_hell.png">

Note:
A salutary tale - whilst working on the slides I failed to follow my own advice and ended up with conflicts.
Explain the merge view, our changes on the left, base version in the middle, other developer's version on the right.

--

## Conflicts

```
 <<<<<<< HEAD:file.txt
 Conflicts
 =======
 What conflicts?
 >>>>>>> 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt
```

+ Must be resolved manually
+ _**BE AFRAID!**_


Note:
What are they  
What do they look like  
What is the effect  
How do you resolve them  

--

## Conflict resolution

+ Easiest to use a powerful tool
+ IDEs support this
    + Will offer to do so if you pull down changes using the IDE and conflict detected
    + Also possible to use the IDE conflict resolution if you `git pull` on the command line
    + IntelliJ: VCS menu > Git > Resolve Conflicts‚Ä¶
+ Once each conflict resolved, need to tell git by ‚Äòadding‚Äô the file

--

## Resolving conflicts in the IDE

+ If you know you can throw one away, do so
+ Otherwise, enter the editor and its three columns
    + Theirs
    + Current
    + Yours
+ Apply non-conflicting changes
+ Look at other changes and attempt to combine both sides without losing anything

--

## Recombining branches

+ Use a Pull Request
+ Merge or rebase on the command line and push

--

## Pull Requests

+ What is a Pull Request?
+ Request via collaboration tool to either merge or rebase one branch into another
+ Two branches might be in different repositories (across forks)
+ GitHub provides shortcut for recently pushed branches
+ GitHub guesses which branches you want to compare for the PR
+ Good practice to delete branch once PR is merged

--

## Merging on the command line

* **Merge** to make sure branch up to date with master:
    ```sh
    git checkout master         # switch to master
    git pull                    # pull down changes
    git checkout feature-branch # switch to fb
    git merge master            # adds new commit
    ```
* Merge branch (with merge commit unless rebased)
    ```sh
    git checkout master         # switch to master
    git merge feature-branch    # adds new commit
    ```

--

## Rebasing on the command line

* **Rebase** to make sure branch up to date with master
    ```sh
    git checkout master         # switch to master
    git pull                    # pull down changes
    git checkout feature-branch # switch to fb
    git rebase master           # rewinds and replays commits
    ```
* Merge branch (with merge commit unless rebased)
    ```sh
    git checkout master         # switch to master
    git merge feature-branch    # adds new commit
    ```


+ Avoids adding a new commit to the feature branch
+ Keeps branch commits together
+ Only safe if you haven‚Äôt pushed commits
    + Unless you force push your branch üò¨‚ö†Ô∏èüö®

--

## Branching scenario

+ You started a new branch, made some changes, and want to push it
+ You run `git push` and you get:
  ```
  fatal: The current branch dummy-branch has no upstream branch.
  To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
  git push --set-upstream origin dummy-branch
  ```
+ What do you need to do?
  + Read the error message!

--

## Tracking remote branches

+ Your master branch will track a remote master branch
  ```
  git branch -vv
  ```
+ New local branches don‚Äôt automatically track remote branches
+ Possible to have a working copy with branches from multiple remotes
  ```
  git push -u <remote> <branch>
  git push --set-upstream <remote> <branch>
  ```
