## What is Continuous Integration

--

> “Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.  
>  
> By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.”  
> —<cite>[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)</cite>

--

> … integrate code into a shared repository …

Note: Integration of many developers code.  
  Shared repository meaning something like Git.  

--

> … several times a day …

Note: could be every five minutes, could be every two hours.  
  Not every three days.  

--

> … verified by an automated build …

Note: verification may mean running something, testing something, or running tools to do ‘static analysis’.  
  Automated for consistency.  
  Ideally the build process is repeatable.  

--

> … detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily …

Note: Why is it good to detect quickly?  
  Mitigate consequences, minimise context switching.  
  Spend more time building features.

## Common sense?

Note: This might sound like common sense, but it is a craft and requires discipline.
