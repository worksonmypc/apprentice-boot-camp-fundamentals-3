## Pros of Feature Branching

+ Once feature released, clean up as simple as deleting the branch
+ If feature abandoned, unused code not left polluting master
+ No need to deal with pesky conflicts while developing
+ Scales well with large number of features in progress

--

## Pros of Trunk Development

+ Changes visible to whole team throughout feature development
+ Code review regular rather than large and unpalatable
+ Feature can be tested on each push
+ Potentially earlier visibility of quality regressions
+ No big, scary merge at the end
